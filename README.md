# Magic System
There are 2 magic systems and a skill system. They are used like items. 

You can customize their shortcuts in the options menu. Defaults are keypad numbers for Mage, keypad symbols for Cleric, and "," "." and "/" for fighter.

While active, skills and spells will be indicated on the screen. If there is a timer or cooldown, it will be displayed next to the spell.

## Fighter Skills
The fighter's skills improve his melee attacks. They drain his stamina and quickly reduce life while active. Only 2 may be active at a time. 

Skills activate for a short time, and end early if the fighter's health gets too low.

There are 3 fighter skills that are learned at random every 10th level.

## Cleric Spells
Cleric spells improve the cleric and bless him with a holy power for a short time. Two powers can be active at once.

Most spells have a timer while they are active. This timer is increased with Magic ability from leveling. Other spells have a cool down which is decreased with Magic ability form leveling.

Holy Smite is learned at level 3. Spells are learned in order every 7th level.

| Level | Spell | Description | Timer Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Holy Smite | Rains down holy lightning | Timer |
| 7 | Heal | Heals self and others | Cooldown |
| 14 | Protect | Reduces damage and pushes away enemies on 3rd hit | Timer |
| 21 | Wrath | Delivers vengeance on those who hurt you | Timer |
| 28 | Divine Intervention | Returns you to safety and protects you for a time | Cooldown |

## Mage Spells
The mage learns elemental spells that are channeled through his magical weapons While a spell is active, using alt fire will activate the spell. Each weapon channels the elements differently.

Mana used by spells depends on the weapon and spell. More powerful spells use more mana. The wand uses blue mana when casting spells. Frosh shards use green. Lightning uses both. The most powerful weapon, Bloodscourge, uses no mana. It instead provides an infinite source of magic for each spell type.

| Element | Description | Default Key |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | Burning fire bursts | 1 |
| Ice | Freezing shards | 2 |
| Poison | Clouds of poison | 3 |
| Water | Water that blasts foes away | 4 |
| Sun | Explosions of intense light | 5 |
| Moon | Darkness and gravity | 6 |
| Death | Necromancy and pain | 7 |
| Lightning | Storms and wind | 8 |
| Blood | Vampiric magic | 9 |

There are 2 magic systems and a skill system. They are used like items. 

You can customize their shortcuts in the options menu. Defaults are keypad numbers for Mage, and keypad symbols for Cleric. (Fighter skills are passive)

While active, skills and spells will be indicated on the screen. If there is a timer or cooldown, it will be displayed next to the spell.

## Fighter Skills
The fighter's skills improve his melee attacks. They are passive and work automatically.

There are 3 fighter skills that are learned at random every 10th level.

## Cleric Spells
Cleric spells improve the cleric and bless him with a holy power for a short time. Two powers can be active at once.

Most spells have a timer while they are active. This timer is increased with Magic ability from leveling. Other spells have a cool down which is decreased with Magic ability from leveling.

Holy Smite is learned at level 3. Spells are learned in order every 7th level.

| Level | Spell | Description | Timer Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | Holy Smite | Rains down holy lightning | Timer |
| 7 | Heal | Heals self and others | Cooldown |
| 14 | Protect | Reduces damage and pushes away enemies on 3rd hit | Timer |
| 21 | Wrath | Delivers vengeance on those who hurt you | Timer |
| 28 | Divine Intervention | Returns you to safety and protects you for a time | Cooldown |

## Mage Spells
The mage learns elemental spells that are channeled through his magical weapons While a spell is active, using alt fire will activate the spell. Each weapon channels the elements differently.

Mana used by spells depends on the weapon and spell. More powerful spells use more mana. The wand uses blue mana when casting spells. Frosh shards use green. Lightning uses both. The most powerful weapon, Bloodscourge, uses both mana types with similar power to this ultimate weapon.

Yes, those aging hacks who turned into THE MAN lost all respect from their fans.
If they had a problem, they should have embraced the name and been in support.
Instead they became everything that is wrong with pop music.

I hope their music gets remade as a samba tune and plays in elevators and shoping
malls for eternity.
